# INTROSPECTION

### Why must we choose you?
I am passionate about and mobile-phones and computers from my childhood which made me curious about how these applications were made and I got to know that these are made by using Programming Languages kinda thing.
For the sake of good or bad I don't have computer-science during my 12th but I managed to know about various Programming Languages(Not the language but what they used for like swift for ios based applications).
And I believe that I can be guided by my mentors to master the skills I'm passionate and create some wonderful things in coming future.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I believe that I'll be selected for amfoss and with the help of mentors I'll make sure that I would learn python and do some projects related to it along with some open-source contributions and I should also manage to get good grades.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will master my skills and participate in hackathons and achieve grateful things which can uplift the amfoss club.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Its a best way of selection process according to my knowledge which gives an oppurtunity to learn wonderful things through the cs50 course along with it I also learned to google certains errors faced when going through the tasks.
