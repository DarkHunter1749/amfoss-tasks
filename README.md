## My views about the tasks
- As I had done the tasks on my own by referring some articles and youtubes other than the given resources, I can say that these tasks aren't that easy but some tasks also aren't that hard to do.
- But I can say that I had learnt plenty of things and though I hadn't completed many of the tasks, I am looking forward to complete those remaining tasks in coming days through which I can improve my skills for making my future-self to do some wonderful-things.
- And I can say that these tasks were wonderful set of tasks beginners like me, Through which we can learn many things.

## My Introduction
- Myself, Manoj and I'm from Andhra Pradesh. I had completed my 11th and 12th in Vijayawada in MPC stream.
- To be honest I am pretty noob in coding and programming kinda stuff but I had some mere knowledge about how these computers work and all.
- During my 12th I had go to know about github, open-source contributions, hackathons and all, I don't why I was fascinated to those things and I got some keen intrest towards them, Which made me create my github account on May 4th,2021 but due to my lack of knwowledge regarding github I wasn't able to do anything in github those days.
- I wanted to learn about it but due to my hectic schedule of classes during my 12th I wasn't able to learn anything.
- But I had gotten across an thread regarding amfoss club in quora through which I got to believe that it will be the perfect club to learn what I needed and do the things which fascinated me😇.
- I had also made my first PR through the workshop conducted by amFOSS club during hactoberfest and got a T-shirt👕.
- And I also participated and completed my first HactoberFest by making 4 PRs with the help of basics I had learnt throught the workshop conducted bt amFOSS and completed which had gone through observation period and matured🥳.
