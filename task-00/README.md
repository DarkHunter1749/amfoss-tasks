# Install Ubuntu 20.04[Desktop]

As I am a mac user I have no need of installing Ubuntu as mentioned in the [tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLvaJYe4Q1w-GBkPVYiIw6XxTlpcjZHbNcZu45K16G8/edit)
But I should start using the terminal more which was not an easy task for beginner's like meðŸ¥². But I managed to learn all the terminal commands by watching youtube videos.
The one which helped me a lot was this [video's in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTvGhHkpvfmKWOiIPF8UVy6c)
