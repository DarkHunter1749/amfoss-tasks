I had used "cd" command to move between directories and "mkdir <directory-name>" to create new directories.
with the help of "cat <file-name.txt>" I was able to open text files and using "cat > <file-name'txt>" I had created .txt files.
Using "cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt" I had combined and files and using the " mv <path of directory the file is in> <path of the directory the file should br moved>"
I had moved the files from one directory to another.
Using "rm -r <name of directory or file>" I had deleted the files and directories.
