# Aerglo Mars

I didn't done the task completely, I done most of the things needed for the task. <br>
This task was a fun one, I had learnt about argparse library along with some other libraries.<br>
Starting I had done the task on my favourite text editor Visual Studio Code but for the task the code I had wriiten needs a python library called requests, which isn't there on my laptop.<br>
That library is installed using the pip command, But I had faced some issues with installing pip. So I had done this task on an online pyhton workspace,which is [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) <br>
With the code I had written I had got the data from the query by taking date as an argument and saved it in a json file.<br>
I should need to write the code to filter the json file using the id of the pictures and get the url of pictures.<br>
I am uploading the code I had written for this task.
