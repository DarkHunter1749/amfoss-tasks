#  Let me C
- This task may look like an complex task, But it was an easier one.
- Most of the things we need to change in this file are adding semi-colons(;), converting some input's to int or something, changing some basic commands along with adding a library and correcting some typo's
- I thought this task would require some good grasping on C but it was just based on basics.
