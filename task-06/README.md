# Flutter based UI task
- This task was an intresting one and I had got to learn how to make apps for android and ios platform at a time.
- Though I had faced some errors during installing android studio and xcode I had installed them finally along with required sdk's.
- I had gone through the resources and learnt about the libraries and widgets But I had faced some error while doing the task.
- So I'll try this one another time after learning some more about the flutter.
