#  Rich Scraper

- This task was not an easy one but not so much hard.
- I had learned about colly package throught this task and a lot more about the html structure in web-pages and and the html tags.
- It was just a complex one and I had referred various articles and youtube videos for this task.
- But I had found one article to be helpful and followed that article and written a golang script which looked fine.
- But when I am running the code it was not scraping any data from the article and was just producing an empty csv fileðŸ¥².
- I am uploading the folder of the code, which I had written. 
- I'll be greatful for knowing about the error I made through which I can learn a new lessons.
- But, after learning some more things about the golang and colly package I will try if anything went wrong in the script.<br>
