#  CS50
- I know about CS50 during my 12th only, I had eagerly waited to join the CS50 course after completion of my 12th.
- And I am grateful that I got a chance to watch those lectures. But I had only watched week 0 and week 1 lectures only.
- But I'll complete in coming days which will be useful for not only this but also I can learn some more basics.
- But I had worked on cs50 IDE for aerglo mars task when I faced an error doing it on my laptop.
