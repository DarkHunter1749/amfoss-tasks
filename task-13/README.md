#  Circuit Design (for Hardware freaks)

This task was fun doing activity, as I was already familiar with [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) through my IOT and EEE Lab sessions, So this task was not much hard for in terms of making the circuit. <br>
But there comes the intresting part, In all the past cases I had used code-blocks in Tinkercad, But in this task I should code in C++, As I was not from CS backgroud it was not an easy task for me. <br>
Though I managed to complete the task by referring some articles in google and knowing how these components work and how we should code to make them work by sharing inputs between them.
